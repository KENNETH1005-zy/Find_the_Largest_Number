# Find the Largest Number Challenge

Given the number of digits and the sum of the digits, find the largest number that can be created.

## Problem Statement

A girl lost the key to her locker (Note: The key is only numeric). She remembers the number of digits **N** and the sum **S** of all the digits of her password. She also knows that her password is the largest number of N digits that can be possible with the given sum S.

Implement a function that helps her retrieve her key.

## Input

- **N**: The number of digits.
- **S**: The sum of the digits.

## Output

Print the largest number that can be created (or the key).  
If the number cannot be formed (for example, when S = 0 for N > 1, or S is too large), print `"Can't find it."`.
